# Local Python Stubs

These types were generated automatically using commands like:

```sh
pipenv run stubgen -p ytmusicapi
```

And then copying the files generated to `./typings/` from `./out/` (where `stubgen`
puts the stubs by default.)

This is a terrible example of python stubs. I filled in only those parts that I
actually used. However I think that this did get close enough that my actual code
will be improved over the `Any`s that used to confuse things.
